# SchoNavi Claude Code Guide

This file gives Claude Code project-specific instructions for working in this repository.

## Project Overview

SchoNavi is a Flutter application for AI-assisted academic and competition navigation. It combines local/mock data, persisted user state, optional HTTP services, and optional LLM-backed reasoning to recommend professors, competitions, and preparation plans.

Primary app entry points:

- `lib/main.dart` starts the Flutter app.
- `lib/app.dart` hosts the app shell.
- `lib/core/router/app_router.dart` defines GoRouter routes.
- `lib/core/di/providers.dart` wires repositories, stores, services, and LLM clients.

## Repository Layout

- `lib/core` — app config, dependency injection, routing, AI clients, storage, theme, and platform services.
- `lib/domain` — business entities, repository interfaces, and domain services.
- `lib/data` — mock data, local persistence, DTOs, HTTP/AI implementations, and data-source adapters.
- `lib/features` — user-facing feature modules and pages.
- `lib/shared` — reusable UI components.
- `assets` — fonts, icons, and preparation-template JSON assets.
- `test` — Flutter unit/widget tests mirroring `lib` structure.
- `web/backend` — FastAPI adapter layer for recommendation backend work.
- `web/backend_agent` — Python recommendation-agent implementation and related data/index workflows.
- `docs/superpowers` — existing design specs and implementation plans.

Avoid `.claude/worktrees/**` unless explicitly working in a selected worktree; those are generated working copies, not source-of-truth project files.

## Architecture Rules

- Keep the layer boundary clear: UI/features depend on domain abstractions; data implementations live under `lib/data`; wiring belongs in `lib/core/di/providers.dart`.
- Prefer existing repository interfaces over direct data access from widgets.
- Keep Riverpod providers manual and explicit unless the surrounding code already uses generated code.
- Use `ProviderScope` overrides in tests instead of global mutable state.
- Use `Result`-style and mock/local implementations consistently with nearby code when adding domain/data behavior.
- Keep LLMs grounded in candidate/source facts; do not let generated text invent professor, competition, or evidence data.
- Keep mock/local paths usable for tests and offline demos even when adding AI or HTTP-backed behavior.
- Do not introduce new state-management, routing, persistence, or HTTP libraries without explicit approval.

## Flutter Conventions

- Current app stack: Flutter/Dart, `flutter_riverpod`, `go_router`, `dio`, `shared_preferences`, `drift`, `flutter_secure_storage`, `gpt_markdown`, and `flutter_svg`.
- Prefer small, feature-local widgets and providers that follow existing feature directory patterns.
- Preserve Chinese product copy style unless the touched screen already uses English.
- For UI changes, run the app and manually verify the changed screen when feasible; tests alone are not enough for visual behavior.
- Do not add broad compatibility shims or feature flags for one-off changes.
- Default to no comments. Add a short comment only when the reason is not obvious from names and structure.

## LLM and Secrets

- Runtime LLM config is supplied through Dart defines or environment variables, not committed files.
- Common Flutter Dart defines: `LLM_API_KEY`, `LLM_BASE_URL`, and `LLM_MODEL`.
- The current LLM path is provider-neutral and DeepSeek/OpenAI-compatible. Do not switch providers or add Anthropic/Claude SDK code unless the user explicitly asks.
- Never commit API keys, tokens, credentials, raw private data, local databases, or real `.env` files.
- Project deployment docs explicitly say: do not create real `.env` files. Use `.env.example` for new key names and keep real values in Doppler or the caller's runtime environment.

## Common Commands

From the repository root:

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter analyze
flutter test
```

Useful targeted checks:

```bash
flutter test test/path/to_test.dart
flutter test test/path/to_test.dart --plain-name "test name"
dart format --set-exit-if-changed lib test
```

For release-tag Android artifact parity with CI:

```bash
flutter build apk --release
```

For backend-agent tests, work inside `web/backend_agent` and prefer isolated tests by default:

```bash
uv run python -m pytest -m "not realdata" -q
```

Only run real-data backend-agent tests after the user confirms local data/indexes are prepared.

## Verification Expectations

- Before reporting a code change complete, run the smallest relevant test first, then broader checks when practical.
- For Flutter code, at minimum consider `flutter analyze` plus targeted `flutter test` files for touched behavior.
- For UI changes, start the app or preview target and exercise the golden path and likely edge cases. If local device/emulator/browser verification is not possible, say so explicitly.
- For backend-agent changes, avoid tests marked `realdata` unless explicitly requested or the user confirms required data exists.
- Do not bypass failing hooks, analyzers, or tests with `--no-verify` or equivalent flags.

## Git and Working Tree Safety

- The working tree may contain user changes. Do not overwrite, delete, reset, clean, or discard files unless the user explicitly authorizes it.
- Do not commit, amend, push, open PRs, or trigger deployments unless explicitly requested.
- Stage specific files only when committing is requested.
- Treat generated worktrees under `.claude/worktrees` as disposable copies; do not edit them from the main session unless the user specifically asks.

## Claude Code Workflow

- For non-trivial implementation tasks, explore first, propose a short plan, and wait for approval when design choices matter.
- Use specialized agents for broad read-only exploration or independent review; avoid duplicating the same search in both the main session and an agent.
- Use tasks/todos for multi-step work and mark items complete as soon as each is done.
- Prefer dedicated tools (`Read`, `Edit`, `Write`, `Glob`, `Grep`) over shell commands for file operations.
- Keep user-facing updates concise: state what changed, what is blocked, or what needs a decision.
- When referencing project files in responses, use clickable relative links such as `[lib/main.dart](lib/main.dart)`.

## Documentation Updates

- Keep `README.md` focused on project overview and launch basics.
- Use `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code behavior and project guardrails.
- Use `AGENTS.md` for tool-neutral instructions for other coding agents.
- Do not create extra planning, status, or summary documents unless the user asks for them.
